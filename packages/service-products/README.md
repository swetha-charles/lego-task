# Service Products

Service Products is a small expressjs application that currently serves up mocked data from our common package.

## Getting started

Starting the server will bring up Gateway running at [localhost:4010](http://localhost:4010/) and there are two routes on the app at the moment; `/products` and `/product/:code`

```bash
# Install dependencies & link packages
yarn

# Run server in development mode
yarn dev
```
