# Service Products

Service Products is a small expressjs application that allows queries on the public star wars API (https://swapi.dev/documentation)

## Getting started

Starting the server will bring up Gateway running at [localhost:4020](http://localhost:4020/) and there are two routes on the app at the moment; `/characters` and `/characters/:code`

```bash
# Install dependencies & link packages
yarn

# Run server in development mode
yarn dev
```
